# SendRec

The async video platform built for Europe. Open source, GDPR native, EU hosted.

## What is SendRec?

SendRec is an open-source alternative to Loom for teams that need their data to stay in the EU. Record your screen, share videos with your team, and keep full control of your data.

- **EU hosted** — all data stored on European servers, never leaves the EU
- **GDPR native** — privacy-first by design, not bolted on after the fact
- **Open source** — AGPLv3 licensed, self-host or use our managed platform
- **No US cloud dependency** — no data transfers to the US, no Schrems II risk

## Status

SendRec is in early development. We're building in public and collecting feedback from EU teams.
